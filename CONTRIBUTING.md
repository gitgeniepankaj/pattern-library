# Contributing to Pattern Library

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Pattern Library! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great place to learn, inspire, and create. Here are some guidelines we ask you to follow:

## Getting Started

- Make sure you read this document carefully and follow the guidelines below.
- Check out the [README](README.md) for a project overview and installation instructions.
- If you are new to GitHub, consider reading [GitHub‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow to Contribute to Open Source‚Äù guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Opening an Issue

Before you submit your issue, search the archive‚Äîmaybe your question was already addressed. If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn‚Äôt been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features by not reporting duplicate issues. Provide as much information as possible when opening your issue. Here's some tips:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if useful to help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Pattern Library which the suggestion is related to.

## Making Changes

When you are ready to start making changes, follow these steps:

- **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints (code standards will be enforced by CI build).
- Issue that pull request!

## Code and Commit Guidelines

- **Ensure your code meets our linting standards.** Run `npm run lint` to check your code.
- **Write tests for new functionality and bug fixes** following our test practices.
- **Use the imperative mood** in the subject line of the commit message (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature").
- **Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji** to categorize your pull request (e.g., ‚ú® for new features, üêõ for bug fixes, and üìù for documentation changes).

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

A pull request often represents a proposed change to the existing code. Here are some tips on how to make sure your pull request is accepted:

- **Fill in the required template** for the pull request.
- **Do not include issue numbers in the PR title**.
- **Provide a description of what this PR accomplishes**. A good description is crucial for us to understand the context of the changes.
- **Keep pull requests small** to facilitate easier review. Grouping small changes into a single PR speeds up the process.
